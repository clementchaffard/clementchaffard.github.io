To make a good ceviche, you will need fresh raw fish or seafood, citrus juice, and seasonings. First, choose your fish or seafood and make sure it is very fresh. Next, cut it into small pieces and marinate it in the citrus juice for at least 30 minutes. This will cook the fish or seafood by denaturing the proteins in it. After the fish or seafood has marinated, add your seasonings, such as chopped onion, cilantro, and chili pepper. You can also add diced avocado and tomato for added flavor and texture. Stir everything together and let it marinate for an additional 10 minutes or so. Serve the ceviche chilled with tortilla chips or crackers on the side.
